# RealTime-Resource-Monitor

**Real-Time System Resource Monitor**  
Sponsor: Jaysson Solano – Jsolano@ASRCFederal.com

This project focuses on developing a C++ application designed to monitor and display real-time system resource utilization on Linux (CPU, memory, disk, network, and GPU).  
It’s particularly relevant for software engineering students as it exposes them to system-level programming, GUI development with Qt, and real-world debugging practices.
