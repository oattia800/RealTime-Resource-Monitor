# RealTime-Resource-Monitor-Spring-25

Real-Time System Resource Monitor RI:  Jaysson Solano  Jsolano@ASRCFederal.com

The project focuses on developing a C++ application designed to monitor and display real-time system resource utilization, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. This application can either be implemented with a graphical user interface using Qt or other graphical libraries. By leveraging C++ and graphical libraries, the project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in building robust system-level applications while gaining familiarity with Linux internals. 

This project is particularly relevant for software engineering students as it exposes them to critical aspects of system programming, including real-time data handling, multithreading, and performance optimization. Working with C++ in a Linux environment will deepen their understanding of operating systems, system resources, and how to interface with them programmatically.
